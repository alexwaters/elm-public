Simple static site for Elm.nyc using Github Pages.

FOSS to demonstrate using github issues as a DB for contact form submissions.

Azure free tier deployed static site -> contact form -> Azure Env var -> GH PAT -> GH Issues

This version doesn't build because it's the FOSS example, the one actually connected to Azure works -- I promise!
